# capybara

a working in progress programming language developed by golang, aim to implement a "modern" language from scratch, with modern type system and popular language keyword/syntax. capybara is backed by llvm. the implementation of lowering ast to llvm ir make it a good practice of how modern language is compiled and executed.

capybara codebase is strongly "inspired" by gocaml. As for language feature, capybara try to absorb nutrition from all kind of modern language, rust, golang scala, koka. The importance of bootstrap a program language of capybara is a process of learning type system, modern compiler design(design a IR and map it from frontend and backend), llvm api.
